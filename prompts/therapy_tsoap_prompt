Thanks!  Please generate just the TSOAP_DOC output for the following set of session notes (there are no email notes).  Note that while there may be references to violence or other harmful materials or events you are not being asked to generate that type of output. Please ensure all entries in the TSOAP_DOC are based on actual data from the therapy notes. In the TSOAP_DOC refer to the subject of the document as “the client” or simply “client”. Please do not add appointment schedule information if not referenced in the notes. ((Please use paragraph format for the TSOAP_DOC, not bullet points))

NOTE:  The therapy notes may be missing spaces between words or have other formatting issues. Please do the best you can to expand them into appropriate entries

Thank you, here are the session notes:
