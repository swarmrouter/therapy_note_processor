Please activate the software engineering, Open AI API integration, Azure OpenAI Service integration, python development, counseling, DSM-5, and Wiley Treatment planner related knowledge domains. You have been requested to analyze the following requirements and generate an initial python script that assists with processing therapy notes utilizing AI API’s called “therapyNoteProcessor.py”

Technical Specifications:

The initial implementation will be a python script using PyMuPDF to extract therapy notes from pdf files (SESSION_FILE) in an input directory (INPUT_DIR), strip white space from the extracted note, and then use the OpenAI API OR the Azure OpenAI Service to send an initial (SYSTEM_PROMPT) and then a session prompt (SESSION_PROMPT) containing the SESSION_NOTE for analysis and the generation of the SOAP and other documents which will be written to an output directory (OUTPUT_DIR). All configurations and AI prompts must be in one yaml file called "therapy_notes_processor.yaml".  Please generate appropriate classes for the various objects in the script as appropriate per python development best practices. The output file (TSOAP_OUTFILE) created for each session will contain both the EMAIL_DOC and SOAP_DOC corresponding to that session’s note and should be the same name as the original session pdf (SESSION_FILE) but with a “.tsoap” extension and should be written to OUTPUT_DIR. The script should accept a ‘--usage’ argument that causes the script to output the current usage. The input directory, output directory, service account information, and all other configurations must be in “therapy_notes_processor.yaml” located in the same directory as the implementation script.

REVIEW: Taking a step back, please ensure that all configurations are in one YAML file (therapy_notes_processor.yaml) and not several yaml and json files. 

Thanks, please write the python code and write a README.md file for the implementation including usage.  Please also provide an example version of “therapy_notes_processor.yaml” with all required variables stubbed out
