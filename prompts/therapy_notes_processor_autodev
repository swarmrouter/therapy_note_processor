You are a software engineer and have been asked to develop an application called “Therapy Note Processor". This application will extract relevant information from pdf files containing raw therapy notes and convert them into structured and standardized SOAP and other output documents that conform to DSM-5 and Wiley Treatment Planner best practices for documenting therapy sessions

Features:

Reads all session notes (SESSION_NOTE) contained in pdf files located in a given directory and utilizes an AI-based therapy notes processing pipeline to process the raw therapy notes using various AI tools into a client follow up EMAIL_DOC and therapy note SOAP_DOC that conform to best practices from the DSM-5 and Wiley Treatment Planner

Technical Specifications:

The initial implementation will be a python script using PyMuPDF to extract therapy notes from pdf files (SESSION_FILE) in an input directory (INPUT_DIR), strip white space from the extracted note, and then use the Azure OpenAI Service to send an initial (SYSTEM_PROMPT) and then a session prompt (SESSION_PROMPT) containing the SESSION_NOTE for analysis and the generation of the SOAP and other documents which will be written to an output directory (OUTPUT_DIR). All configurations and AI prompts must be in one yaml file called "therapy_notes_processor.yaml".  Please generate appropriate classes for the various objects in the script as appropriate per python development best practices. The output file (TSOAP_OUTFILE) created for each session will contain both the EMAIL_DOC and SOAP_DOC corresponding to that session’s note and should be the same name as the original session pdf (SESSION_FILE) but with a “.tsoap” extension and should be written to OUTPUT_DIR. The script should accept a ‘--usage’ argument that causes the script to output the current usage. The input directory, output directory, service account information, and all other configurations must be in “therapy_notes_processor.yaml” located in the same directory as the implementation script.

REVIEW: Taking a step back, please ensure that all configurations are in one YAML file (therapy_notes_processor.yaml) and not several yaml and json files. 

Thanks, please develop the python code and write a README.md file for the implementation including usage. Please also provide an example version of “therapy_notes_processor.yaml” with all required variables stubbed out
