# Therapy Notes Analyzer

This project aims to analyze and process raw therapy notes using various AI tools and generate useful output such as therapy notes and treatment summaries in Subjective,Objective,Assessment,Plan (SOAP) format consistent with the DSM-5 and Wiley Treatment Planner.

## Motivation

Therapy notes are an essential part of the clinical documentation process, as they provide a record of the client's progress, challenges, goals, and interventions. However, writing therapy notes can be time-consuming, tedious, and prone to errors. Moreover, therapy notes often contain sensitive and confidential information that requires proper protection and privacy.

This project seeks to address these challenges by using AI tools to automate and enhance the therapy notes writing process. By using natural language processing, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and other techniques, this project aims to:

- Extract relevant information from raw therapy notes and convert them into structured and standardized SOAP format
- Generate concise and accurate treatment summaries that highlight the main points and outcomes of each session
- Provide suggestions and recommendations for future treatment plans based on the client's diagnosis, goals, and progress
- Ensure the security and privacy of the therapy notes data by using encryption, anonymization, and other methods
